## Method
(outline the main novel equation/algorithm/idea)

### Method choice justification
(why this method and not another, why these steps)

## Anticipated results
 that back up the contribution claims and outperform competing methods (which state of the art competing methods are you comparing with? Are you sure there are no newer/better methods to compare with? How are you ensuring it is a fair comparison (e.g. using same training and test data, e.g. using public challenge data)? How are you sure that you are faithful to the compering methods (e.g. did you use code from the authors of competing methods)? how will the results be presented, show mock-up graphs, tables with proper headings and labels)
